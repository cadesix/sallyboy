  <div class="masthead"> SALLY BOY </div><br>

  <div class="intro">Until I write, unconsciously often via stream of thought, I don&#39t really know what I&#39m feeling, who I am mad at, or why I&#39m mad at all. A lot of my ability to express exactly how I feel without shame has dissipated as I&#39ve grown. I seemed to get the hang of it a bit too young for my own good, and maybe it was the people around me, or perhaps the sense of defeat within myself that forced that extremely helpful tool out of my belt at a young age.
That, it seems to me, is why I yearn to be young again. To have the innocence to express how I feel, when I want to. Not to bottle it up until it comes out in anger, pushing away those closest to me. Ugh, what a waste.
I think I&#39ll figure it out one day, but in the meantime, people can enjoy my means of therapy.</div><br>
